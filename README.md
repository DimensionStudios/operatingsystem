# Operating System
## Rules
use c++ 23  
run with clang  
compile down to asm if needed (bootloader)  
try to stick to one language  
if a var/func is private, start the name with "p_"  
Before you make a commit, always use cppcheck to make sure it is optimised (if using c++)  
Use the 'const' function whenever possible  
Do not use raw pointers unless it links to a C library, instead use smart pointers  
Once ready, we will only test the OS on a VM while on a call in case there is a big issue  

 
## TODO
* Make ASM code run a c file
